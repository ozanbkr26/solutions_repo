# Problem 1 – Newton's Second Law

## Problem Statement

A force of **10 Newtons** is applied to a body of mass **2 kilograms** on a horizontal surface.  
Calculate the acceleration of the object.

---

## Given:

- Force: \( F = 10\, \text{N} \)  
- Mass: \( m = 2\, \text{kg} \)

---

## Formula:

Newton’s Second Law:

\[
F = m \cdot a \Rightarrow a = \frac{F}{m}
\]

---

## Calculation:

\[
a = \frac{10}{2} = 5\, \text{m/s}^2
\]

---

## Final Answer:

> The acceleration of the object is **5 meters per second squared**.
