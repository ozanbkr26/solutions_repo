# Problem 9 – Set Theory and Venn Diagrams

## Problem Statement
Given two sets:  
- Set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
- Set B = {4, 5, 6, 7}  

Perform the following operations and illustrate using a Venn Diagram:
- Union (A ∪ B)
- Intersection (A ∩ B)
- Difference (A − B)

## Given:
- A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- B = {4, 5, 6, 7}

## Operations:
- Union: A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Intersection: A ∩ B = {4, 5}
- Difference: A − B = {1, 2, 3}

## Visualization
Below is a Venn diagram illustrating the union and intersection:
