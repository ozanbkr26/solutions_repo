# Problem – Relations in Set Theory

## Problem Statement

Given two sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5}, determine the Cartesian product A × B and represent it graphically.

## Given:

- A = {1, 2, 3}
- B = {4, 5}

## Formula:

- Cartesian Product: A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}

## Solution:

A × B =  
{  
(1,4), (1,5),  
(2,4), (2,5),  
(3,4), (3,5)  
}

## Visualization

Below is a graphical representation of A × B:
