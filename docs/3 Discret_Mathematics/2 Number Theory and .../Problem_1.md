# Problem 13 – Modular Arithmetic and Prime Numbers

## Problem Statement
Given a list of integers, identify which are prime, and compute their modulo with respect to a fixed number (e.g., 7).

## Given:
- Integers: 11, 14, 17, 22, 29
- Modulo: 7

## Solution:
1. Prime Numbers: 11, 17, 29
2. Modular Results:  
   - 11 % 7 = 4  
   - 17 % 7 = 3  
   - 29 % 7 = 1

## Visualization
