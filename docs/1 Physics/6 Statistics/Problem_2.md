# Problem 7 – Probability Basics

## Problem Statement

A die is rolled once. What is the probability of getting a number greater than 4?

## Given:

- Sample Space: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Favorable Outcomes: {5, 6}

## Formula:

\[
P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}
\]

## Calculation:

\[
P(\text{greater than 4}) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

## Visualization
