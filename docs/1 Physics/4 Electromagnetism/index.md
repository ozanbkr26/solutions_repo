# Problem 4 – Electromagnetic Induction

## Problem Statement

A circular loop of radius 0.1 m is placed in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to its plane. The magnetic field changes uniformly from 0.5 T to 0 T in 2 seconds. Calculate the induced EMF in the loop.

---

## Given:

- Radius \( r = 0.1 \, \text{m} \)
- Initial magnetic field \( B_i = 0.5 \, \text{T} \)
- Final magnetic field \( B_f = 0 \, \text{T} \)
- Time interval \( \Delta t = 2 \, \text{s} \)

---

## Formula:

Faraday’s Law of Induction:

\[
\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} = -\frac{A \cdot (B_f - B_i)}{\Delta t}
\]

Where:

- \( \mathcal{E} \) is the induced EMF
- \( A = \pi r^2 \) is the area of the loop

---

## Calculation:

\[
A = \pi (0.1)^2 = 0.0314 \, \text{m}^2 \\
\mathcal{E} = -\frac{0.0314 \cdot (0 - 0.5)}{2} = 0.00785 \, \text{V}
\]

---

## Final Answer:

The induced EMF in the loop is approximately **0.00785 volts**.
