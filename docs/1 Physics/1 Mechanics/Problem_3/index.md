# Problem 3 – Motion Under Gravity

## Problem Statement

A ball is thrown vertically upward with an initial velocity of 20 m/s.  
Calculate the maximum height it reaches and the total time it takes to return to the ground.

---

## Assumptions

- No air resistance
- Gravity is constant: \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)

---

## Formulas

- Maximum height: \( h = \frac{v_0^2}{2g} \)
- Time to reach max height: \( t = \frac{v_0}{g} \)
- Total time: \( T = 2t \)

---

## Solution

\[
h = \frac{20^2}{2 \cdot 9.8} = \frac{400}{19.6} \approx 20.41 \, \text{m}
\]

\[
t = \frac{20}{9.8} \approx 2.04 \, \text{s}
\Rightarrow T = 4.08 \, \text{s}
\]

---

## Result

- Maximum height: **20.41 m**
- Total time of flight: **4.08 s**
