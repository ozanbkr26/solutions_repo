# Problem 2 – Friction on Inclined Plane

## Problem Statement

A 5 kg block is placed on a 30° inclined plane. The coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.2.  
Calculate the net force acting on the block as it slides down.

---

## Given:

- Mass \( m = 5 \, \text{kg} \)
- Incline angle \( \theta = 30^\circ \)
- Coefficient of kinetic friction \( \mu_k = 0.2 \)

---

## Formulas:

- Gravitational force component: \( F_g = m \cdot g \cdot \sin(\theta) \)
- Normal force: \( N = m \cdot g \cdot \cos(\theta) \)
- Friction force: \( f_k = \mu_k \cdot N \)
- Net force: \( F_{net} = F_g - f_k \)

---

## Calculation:

\[
\begin{align*}
F_g &= 5 \cdot 9.8 \cdot \sin(30^\circ) = 24.5 \, \text{N} \\
N &= 5 \cdot 9.8 \cdot \cos(30^\circ) \approx 42.44 \, \text{N} \\
f_k &= 0.2 \cdot 42.44 \approx 8.49 \, \text{N} \\
F_{net} &= 24.5 - 8.49 = 16.01 \, \text{N}
\end{align*}
\]

---

## Final Answer:

The net force acting on the block is approximately **16.01 N** down the incline.
